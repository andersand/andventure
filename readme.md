==========

Yet Another Adventure Game, mostly making this to learn. 

Technical details
-----------------

* Using the [Slick 2d](http://www.slick2d.org/) java game library
* I'm making everything else myself, and the graphics are not that good. I like to think the code is better :-)
* The levels are in a custom text format that can be edited in any normal text editor.

Well, that's all there is to say at the moment.
